## Task:
To understand the purpose of a Ticketing System

### Food for thought
When an alert is triggered in any security tools, it's important to keep track of these
triggered alerts. By doing so, it is possible to figure out any potential signs of attacks, 
misconfigurations or attacks. 

But how can these alerts be tracked? With a Ticketing System. 

### Ticketing System 
A ticket can be about an alert, complaint, troubleshooting request, or any request. 
Some popular softwares are JIRA, Zendesk, Freshdesk. 

In this project, the system introduced is osTicket.
