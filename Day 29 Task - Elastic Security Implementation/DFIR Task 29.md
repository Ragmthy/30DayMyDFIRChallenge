Creator of Exercise: MyDFIR (Steven)

## Task:
To install Elastic's Endpoint Detection & Response. 

### Summary
For this task, the purpose is to see how we can protect a server of ours and see how alerts get generated when an unfamiliar executable is attempts to run.

### Installation
As per [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ec-Ab8TbJKs). 

Some things that can be observed:

### Conclusion
A really nicely put challenge. Some days towards the end were challenging when it comes to investigating out events from logs. 
A suitable playlist to then pursue and learn would be the [Cybersecurity SOC Analyst Hands-On Labs](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLG6KGSNK4PuDdqYkOuIlAoNmwtLg5wyYJ&si=dVhofEJvnKXNwotb). 

After understanding the bigger picture of Infrastructure and monitoring it as a SOC Analyst, this following playlist will now be more granular 
and help one understand better each type of alert or suspicious artifact (i.e. a phishing email) and what to do to dissect it better.
