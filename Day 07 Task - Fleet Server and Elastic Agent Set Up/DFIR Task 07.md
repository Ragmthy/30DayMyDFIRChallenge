Creator of Exercise: MyDFIR (Steven)

## Task:
Set Up of Elastic Agent and Fleet Server

## Summary: 
In this challenge, we're interested to get telemetry and logs from our Windows Server. For those logs to be recorded and published into the ELK's Web GUI, an agent should be installed inside the Windows Server first. 

After that, that Windows Server should be installed into a Fleet server. 

Therefore, there are 2 parts to this video:
1. To create a Server on Vultr
2. Add that as a Fleet Server with Elastic's Web GUI and make it ready to act as a Fleet server.
3. To install the Elastic Agent into our Windows Server, and ensure this Windows server can communicate with the Fleet server.
