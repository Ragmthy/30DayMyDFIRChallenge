## Task:
Set up of Elasticsearch Ingesting Data

## Summary: 
So, from previous days, we have installed Elastic agent into our Windows server, to ensure it can communicate with our ELK server to send over telemetry. 
And on this day, it's to ensure that ELK is properly receiving and ingesting the data, and making it visible for us in its GUI. 

#### Set-up Process:
As per [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eOie0SDMuGA) </br>
Also, testing it out by initiating some User events in the Windows Server to get their telemetry captured.
