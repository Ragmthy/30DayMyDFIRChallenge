## Task:
To visualise out alerts from our simulated attack from Day 21, and narrow down data across our servers to find this "time point of attack". 

### Sample Visualisations

### Instructions
As per [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WcVuUamMApA)

#### Food for thought
Choosing the right fields is a keypoint in making the visualisations clearer and less cluttered. Would bear some research and KQL practice is needed to make the queries fast.
