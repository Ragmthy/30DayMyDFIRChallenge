## Task:
Overview of Brute Force Attacks

## Summary: 
Brute Force attack is a hacking method that uses trial and error to crack passwords or login credentials. It's a simple and easy-to-use method to attempt logins. 

### Common types of Brute Force Attacks:
1. Automated Brute Force attacks -- essentially trial and error, but sped up. 

2. Dictionary Attack -- Makes use of a list of passwords/phrases/credentials that were sourced out from credential dumps. Gives a narrower set of possibilities to work with for brute forcing. These lists are often a result of a successful data breach at some point in time. 

3. Credential Stuffing -- Trying every combination possible from a credential dump. Counts on the user to reuse some of these credentials

### Ways to protect against Brute Force Attacks:
1. Long passwords and/or long passphrases 
2. Multifactor Authentication
3. Constant Vigilance
